## Introduction
Building energy system calculations for early design and operation according to SN/TS 3031:2016.

Tools are written in C++ for R.

## Modules
- PV Electricity generation
- STC Solar thermal collector
- AWHP Air to water heat pump module
- GSHP Ground source heat pump module
- AAHP Air to air heat pump modul
- Fuel and CHP Combined heat and power boilers
- Electric boiler etc.

## Plans
Create a tool similar to what is presented in "Guidelines on energy system analysis and cost optimality in early design of ZEB".
